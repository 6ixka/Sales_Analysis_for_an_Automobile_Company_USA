# Sales_Analysis_for_an_Automobile_Company_USA
A Data Science Project that Analysed  the sales performance of an Automobile company Based in the United States. The companyâ€™s sales transaction data generated over the past years was used for this  analysis.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
What are the Top Most-Profitable 5 States for a Bike business in the United State ?

## DATA PRE-PROCESSING 
#### DATA LOADING
```Python
# importing all the necessary python packages 

# solution 

import numpy as np 
import pandas as pd 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

print("Packages successfully imported")


```



```Python
# reading the sales data into a pandas dataframe

# Solution

bikes_df =  pd.read_csv('C:/Users/Admin/Documents/_EXCLUSIVE DATA SCIENCE BOOT CAMP_STUDENT FOLDER/_DATASET/bikes.csv')
bikes_df.head()


```
#### DATA MODIFICATION 

```
# (1). Adding the following 3 columns to your pandas Dataframe:  bikes_df




# TotalCostPrice : To be obtained by (OrderQuantity x CostPrice_usd)


bikes_df["TotalCostPrice"] = bikes_df["OrderQuantity"] * bikes_df["CostPrice_usd"] 


# SalesRevenue : To be obtained by (OrderQuantity x SellingPrice_usd)


bikes_df["SalesRevenue"] = bikes_df["OrderQuantity"] * bikes_df["SellingPrice_usd"] 



# Profit : To be obtained by (SalesRevenue - TotalCostPrice)



bikes_df["Profit"] = bikes_df["SalesRevenue"] - bikes_df["TotalCostPrice"]


bikes_df.head()


```

## DATA ANALYSIS 

#### DATA FILTERING

```
# Filtering out only the data relevant to solving the problem statement

is_USA = bikes_df["CustomerCountry"] == "United States"
is_bike = bikes_df["ProductCategory"] == "Bikes"
bike_in_US = bikes_df[(is_USA) & (is_bike) ]
bike_in_US.head()
```

#### DATA AGGREGATION 
```
# aggregating the total profit in the United States for bike sales

total_profit_by_states = bike_in_US.pivot_table(values = "Profit" , index = "CustomerState" , aggfunc = np.sum)
total_profit_by_states
```
