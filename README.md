#### DATA MODIFICATION 

```
# (1). Adding the following 3 columns to your pandas Dataframe:  bikes_df




# TotalCostPrice : To be obtained by (OrderQuantity x CostPrice_usd)


bikes_df["TotalCostPrice"] = bikes_df["OrderQuantity"] * bikes_df["CostPrice_usd"] 


# SalesRevenue : To be obtained by (OrderQuantity x SellingPrice_usd)


bikes_df["SalesRevenue"] = bikes_df["OrderQuantity"] * bikes_df["SellingPrice_usd"] 



# Profit : To be obtained by (SalesRevenue - TotalCostPrice)



bikes_df["Profit"] = bikes_df["SalesRevenue"] - bikes_df["TotalCostPrice"]


bikes_df.head()


```

## DATA ANALYSIS 

#### DATA FILTERING

```
# Filtering out only the data relevant to solving the problem statement

is_USA = bikes_df["CustomerCountry"] == "United States"
is_bike = bikes_df["ProductCategory"] == "Bikes"
bike_in_US = bikes_df[(is_USA) & (is_bike) ]
bike_in_US.head()
```

#### DATA AGGREGATION 

```
# aggregating the total profit in the United States for bike sales

total_profit_by_states = bike_in_US.pivot_table(values = "Profit" , index = "CustomerState" , aggfunc = np.sum)
total_profit_by_states
```

#### DATA SORTING

```
# Sorting the aggregated data in order to rank the state according to the top most profitable states
total_profit_by_states.sort_values("Profit", ascending = False)
```
